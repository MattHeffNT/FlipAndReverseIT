# FlipAndReverseIT
A quick little string reverser to save me time when there are no Endnote citations files availble and the only author information is in "first name, last name" format. This is just a quick script that pastes the correctly formatted names into a text file which you can then copy and paste straight into Endnote.

Now you can do the things online:
